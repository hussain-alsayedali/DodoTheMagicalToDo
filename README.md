## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS(tailwind), JavaScript, Node. 

my goal of this project was to learn tailwind and challenge myself with some javascript DOM manipulation. 

## Optimizations

I think the UI colors and design could be better. maybe making a tutorial to the user at first visit.

## Lessons Learned:

I started this project to learn tailwind and i succeed in this regard and found it easier and faster to work with than vanilla CSS.
local storage was another goal of this project which i also got familiar with.
